### Which Assignments and Why?
- Which assignments did you choose to complete this week?
- Why did you choose these assignments?
1. Goals - it's required.  Isn't that funny!  I'm sure you haven't heard that one before.  Please, please, no applause.  
2. Side Project - I don't have time to do the job-stalking thing before tomorrow.  I think that's the most valuable one and I plan on doing it next week.
