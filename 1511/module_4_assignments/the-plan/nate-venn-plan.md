### Submitted Assignments

### The Plan

#### build a React app
* Currently, I have followed along with one React Tutorial and contributed to
a React app (LookingFor). I have also written a blog post on a architecture
that works really well with React called Flux.
* Success for me would be when I have a working app that is all
in React. It would be thoroughly tested, probably using the enzyme testing
suite. It will follow the the flux pattern.
* Outline
- Finish the React for Beginners tutorial
- Continue listening to the React Podcasts
- Continue reading blog posts about React
- Sign up for [Egghead]('https://egghead.io/technologies/react') learning videos. These videos come straight from the
React team.
- Rebuild IdeaBox in React
- build a Kanban React app [SurviveJS]('http://survivejs.com/')
- Join the ReactJS Denver meetup. Third Thursday of each month
- participate in a one day [ReactJS workshop]('http://lanyrd.com/2016/nfjs-uberconf/sdytpy/')
* this is important to me beacuse I really enjoy working in React and it seems
that React is becoming a hot new framework that could lead me to a job.

#### Finish all JavaScript and Ruby exercisms
* Currently I have 4 JS exercise and 14 Ruby exercises complete
* success for me would be when they are all finished
* Outline
