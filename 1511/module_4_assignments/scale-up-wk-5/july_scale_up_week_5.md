# Instructor Evaluation:

Good job on tackling something that was challenging. You seemed engaged and participating in stand up, and it was great to hear when you'd hit a fustration point with your project fight your way out of it. Great job of communication when you needed mentor support and being specific about what kind of support you needed.
