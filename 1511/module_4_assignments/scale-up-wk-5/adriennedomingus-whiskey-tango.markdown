### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.

* Swagger. Tons of options/libraries for integration, and I might choose a different one next time, but I felt good about what I did this time because it gave me a lot of control over what showed up. Other options are more automated, so may be better choices now that I have a feel for what it can do.

* ActiveModel Serializers. I mean, I knew about them, but I got a lot more in depth with them on this project - I was able to find some of their power, and also find some of their limitations (or at least limitations in what I knew how to do with them). I would like to keep exploring this and find cleaner ways to implement what I did.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback

I got great feedback. Having Geoff involved was invaluable. Feedback from my peers was intermittent but valuable when provided. I didn't feel like I was able to provide valuable feedback on my peer's PRs and wish that I had. Because they were almost exclusively React/other frameworks that I don't know, I didn't feel that my feedback was particularly valuable.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

Mostly positive. It was interesting to hear what everyone was working on. I wonder what the experience was like for those actually collaborating on something. I think it's a good introduction to the concept, but I wonder if a lot of it's power was lost 1. since we were such small teams and likely could keep up with what everyone was working on if collaborating, or 2. Our work wasn't dependent on anyone else's work, so the main purpose for it was lost.

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

I really enjoyed the ability to redo things and clean up without feeling pressure to deliver more features - that's a unique experience at Turing, but I found it super valuable. Really loved the freedom of this project.

# Instructor Evaluation:

150/150

Really great work on this project. Kind of the dream independent study :D

Cool topics for the blog posts - keep an eye on spelling - your first paragraph of one had 'education' misspelled. I'd recommend using a little more 'text' structure to keep the reader interested - like bolding certain parts - just because the images are so large and have a lot of text in them.

Suggestion for the site - it's amazing. Maybe have a little bit of an 'about' section that just copies and pastes the things you have in this submission form.

Points: (max 150)

### Blog Post (40 Points)  

  * 40: Developer has >= 2 blog posts documenting something they have worked on for their independent study or has one in depth blog post.
  
### Team Participation (40 points)

  * 40: Developer participated daily in stand ups with the group (remote or in person). Developer was able to speak to their work in stand ups in a way that was clear and informative. Developer was involved in pull request reviews.

### Hourly Work (30 points)

  * 30: Developer logged 7 to 8 hours per working day. Developer can speak to work completed during those hours.

### Risk Taking and Creativity (40 points)
