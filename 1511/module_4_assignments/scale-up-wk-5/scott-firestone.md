# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Summarize the work you completed over the last two weeks

Over the last couple of weeks, I worked tried to learn React. I spent a lot of time working through the React for Beginners Tutorial
and various articles/blog posts, while trying to build a React front-end for my Mod 3 personal project (UpTune). Ultimately I did not make as
much progress as I would have liked with UpTune, as debugging issues ending up taking much more time than anticipated. I do feel like, 
especially over the last few days of the project, really started to understand the basic paradigm of the language (perhaps due to 
the banging-head-against-wall approach), and feel good about continuing to improve my abilities moving forward.

### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.

I didn't know how to effectively use state prior to this week. Before, I thought it was something that would exist for each component to
govern how it would behave/render. Rather, setting state very high in the hierarchy is ideal as it allows context-specific props to be passed
down to children.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback

I found it difficult to give good PR reviews, especially where the code bases were so foreign and complicated (e.g. Adam). 
As far as feedback, most students were very thoughtful and helpful in the feedback they provided. I found myself getting better 
at leaving WIP branches in a place where they could be easily reviewed, providing better forword notes.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

I liked daily standups. It was interesting to hear what everyone else was working through on a daily basis, as their problems 
were sometimes unique and other times very relevant to my own. They would sometimes lead to teammates helping each other on 
shared issues discussed in said stand ups.
