# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Summarize the work you completed over the last two weeks

Over the last 2 weeks I took my game time project and made it fully mobile compatible. I implemented new gameplay features such as rendering color blocks on the left side of the display and pausing when the device is turned portrait. I also implemented a full global scoreboard with name inputs stored on firebase.

### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.

I learned 2 very beneficial things this week. The first was basically everything during our REGEX lesson. Up until last week I had basically never used regex and never really understood how to write one. That lesson blew my mind and also gave some context on when it is appropriate to use regex.

In my work on my scale up project I learned a bunch regarding promises and Firebase. I chained multiple `.then()` functions together on a Firebase promise and was able to adjust the top scoreboard table. Working with Firebase and React challenged my logic abilities. React needs everything to be loaded in order to render the component, this meant I had to deal with all the promises being returned. It was a great lesson.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback

PR reviews are great and hard all at the same time. As I PR reviewed other peoples code, I found that I learned more from viewing their code that I actually gave them feedback. It is hard to comment on code when you don't really know what is going on. I loved receiving the feedback as selfish as that is. I can really see how PR reviews in a company are going to be instrumental in my growth as a developer.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
I really enjoyed participating in the daily stand-ups. I found it super beneficial to have to communicate what I had done and what I was going to do. It really kept me accountable with actually accomplishing something each day. I really enjoyed hearing what other people were up to as well. I have been at companies that do remote stand-ups but after Scale Up I believe I prefer in person.
