# Internal Community Involvement

  * I lead the Hopper Posse and get together every morning with people to help on their projects and/or any academic support they may need.
  * I'm also heavily involved with Pahlka Posse. I've helped a lot with the making of the Affordable Housing App. I pair weekly with members of the posse. And I also made a screencast to explain how our API calls work. You can see that [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6FVzDe6_S8).
  * I also run a little group called Imposters. We meet weekly and it's essentially a support group for people at school who may or may not be suffering from Imposter Syndrome.
  * Also on top of all that stuff, I randomly pair with anyone who asks me for help. I've come in on Saturdays and Sundays to pair with people.
  * Also also, I helped TA a GDI ran by Lovisa, which was also on a Saturday.
  * And also also also, I've helped Rachel by TAing at a few community outreach events. That includes this weekend at the Try Turing event!

I've done a lot for this community, especially this module. I believe I should get the full 50 points. Thank you for agreeing with me.
