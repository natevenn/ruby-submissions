# Brennan Extra Credit

I started a podcast during the tail-end of my first time through module 1.

Publishing is usually sporadic, happening most Fridays. This module I have successfully to published every week.

Topics this module have included a two-part piece with Lia on job hunting during and after Turing, A State of Turing talk with Jeff, and a Turing recap with Rachel. Plans for this week are a wrap-up (focused on the diabolical projects he's created) with Horace, and next week, Matthew in Mod 1 is taking over and interviewing me, for some reason. I'll try to keep it interesting.
